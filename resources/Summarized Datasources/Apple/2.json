    "data_content": "Warren Buffett, a strong supporter of Apple, has said that the company's brand loyalty is a key reason for his admiration. He believes that iPhone users are so devoted to their devices that they would not part with them for $10,000. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds the largest equity investment in Apple, valued at $151bn, constituting about 6% of its portfolio. Buffett sees Apple not just as a tech firm but as a consumer-oriented business, citing the success of products developed by Steve Jobs and led by CEO Tim Cook. He sees parallels with Berkshire's substantial stake in railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe and utility firm Berkshire Hathaway Energy."
