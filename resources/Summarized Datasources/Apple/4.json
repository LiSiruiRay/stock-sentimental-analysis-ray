    "data_content": "Apple's upcoming spy thriller, \"Argylle,\" directed by Matthew Vaughn and starring Henry Cavill, will have a wide theatrical release through a distribution partnership with Universal Pictures before heading to the streaming platform Apple TV+. This follows a similar strategy for Apple's previous movies, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and \"Napoleon,\" which are also getting theatrical releases before streaming. It is unclear whether the partnership with Universal is a one-off or a sign of more to come. Apple is planning to invest $1 billion annually into movies with theatrical releases, and \"Argylle\" is set to be released in theaters on February 2, 2024."
