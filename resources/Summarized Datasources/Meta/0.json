    "data_content": "Tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google-parent Alphabet have implemented cost-cutting measures, with hiring slowdowns or freezes. The tech sector's pandemic boom has turned into a post-pandemic bust due to rising interest rates, which have affected share prices and cut into profits. Nearly 200,000 tech jobs paying a combined $12 billion annually have been wiped out so far, surpassing the 165,000 jobs cut for the whole of 2022. Companies such as Meta, Twitter, Salesforce, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, Lyft, and Spotify have announced major layoffs this year. Apple has not announced any major layoffs but has slowed some hiring."
