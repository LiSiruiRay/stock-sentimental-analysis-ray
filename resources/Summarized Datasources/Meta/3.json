    "data_content": "Ninja Warriors Meta is a new decentralized gaming platform that uses real-time dynamics and a dual token system for stability. The primary token, $NWT, will be used for buying and selling Ninjas and their equipment, upgrading the ninja, and topping up vitality, while the secondary token, $DBUSD, is a stablecoin that players earn. The platform offers multiple gaming modes, including a solo mode, PvP mode, and tournaments that allow players to wager their $NWT. The platform also plans to release an Android and iOS Move-to-Earn app in two months, which will reward users for recording their physical activities. The presale registration is open for those interested in participating in the token sale event."
