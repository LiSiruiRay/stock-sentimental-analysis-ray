    "data_content": "Alphabet and Meta were among the top-paying public companies in 2022, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. Despite laying off around 33,000 workers since 2022, these companies offer some of the highest median salaries. Vici Properties, a real-estate-investment trust with just 22 employees, offered the highest median salary of around $415,000. Tech layoffs and a pullback on employee perks have not significantly affected median salary ranges. The CEO of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, took home the highest salary package of $226 million, which is 808 times more than the company's median pay."
