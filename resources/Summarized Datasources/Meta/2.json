    "data_content": "Meta's decision to ease some of its COVID-19 misinformation policies has raised concerns among public health experts who fear it will lead to more disinformation about the virus, treatments, and vaccines. The policies will not be upheld in the US due to the expiration of the emergency declaration, but they will remain in countries that still have one. The move has been widely criticized, with infectious disease specialists warning that the misinformation could reach vulnerable groups such as teenagers, and that the pandemic is not yet over. Experts recommend that people be careful about what they read online and look for trusted sources such as public health agencies."
