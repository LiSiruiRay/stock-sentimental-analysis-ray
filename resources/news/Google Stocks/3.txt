After a brief absence, Google stock has bounced back onto this screen emulating Warren Buffett stocks based on the investing strategy of the Berkshire Hathaway CEO. Alphabet (GOOGL) beat Q1 earnings estimates on April 25 and the stock is now soaring after the company announced fresh artificial intelligence initiatives.

Note that inclusion on this screen does not necessarily mean the Oracle of Omaha owns shares in these companies. Rather, it identifies stocks in sync with Buffett's focus on sustainable earnings growth and other factors.

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) join Google stock in cultivating a spot on the list. Homebuilders PulteGroup (PHM) and D.R. Horton (DHI) are also among 35 companies that also make this stock screen.

In terms of tech stocks in sync with Buffett's investing criteria, Alphabet joins Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), STMicroelectronics (STM), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Epam Systems (EPAM), Power Integrations (POWI), Globant (GLOB) and Taiwan-based United Microelectronics (UMC).

Like Google stock, SMCI has shot higher and is now extended.

Building materials manufacturer Atkore (ATKR) tops the list with an impressive sustainable earnings growth rate of 90%. (The rate is computed by multiplying the company's ROE by the earnings retention ratio, which is the percentage of earnings not paid out as dividends.)

Along with Atkore, Steel Dynamics (STLD) and solar energy play Daqo New Energy (DQ) form a trio of companies with a sustainable growth rate over 50%.

Lululemon joins a foursome of firms with a growth rate between 40% and 49%, including Nucor (NUE), Tecnoglass (TGLS) and Mueller Industries (MLI).

Retail stocks Boot Barn (BOOT) and Buckle (BKE) find shelf space on the list alongside Lululemon.

Lululemon, Google In Style With Warren Buffett Stocks

Since the Oracle of Omaha has never written a book detailing his investment strategy, there's no definitive buying checklist. But parts of Buffett's stock-picking strategy can be gleaned from the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).

While not a list of companies necessarily owned by Buffett or Berkshire, the list below highlights Warren Buffett stocks like Alphabet, Lululemon, Monolithic Power Systems, Copart (CPRT) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) in sync with Buffett's focus on management quality and long-term growth.

Created in MarketSmith, the screen below emphasizes metrics to use when looking for companies with long-term past, and potential future, growth. To make the list, each stock must meet a wide range of criteria, including:

In the top 25% of all stocks in terms of five-year annual EPS growth rate.

15% or greater sustainable earnings growth.

12% or better five-year average return on equity.

Warren Buffett Stocks In Demand By Top Funds

The latest list of new buys by the best mutual funds features several names also highlighted in this screen of Warren Buffett-style stocks.

In addition to Lululemon, Copart, Mueller Industries, Tecnoglass, Novartis (NVS) and homebuilders PulteGroup (PHM) and Tri Pointe Homes (TPH) all make both lists.

As MLI and LULU stock try on new buy zones, strong moves in the other companies named here further reveal their noteworthy institutional demand.

IBD Stock Ratings Vs. The Oracle Of Omaha

IBD uses different criteria than those used to build this screen emulating certain characteristics of Warren Buffett stocks. PHM and SMCI stock, for example, sport a very strong 98 Composite Rating. The rating means the stocks of these leaders are outpacing 98% of all companies in terms of key stock-picking traits. Lululemon, Copart, Novartis and many others also earn strong ratings in IBD Stock Checkup.

Google stock continues its rebound following all the carnage in the tech sector last year, with its Composite Rating rebounding to 93.

Many companies on the list do meet typical Warren Buffett criteria but do not meet some benchmarks that CAN SLIM investors seek in the other stock ratings that gauge a company's fundamental, as well as technical, strength.

Ranging from 1 (worst) to 99 (best), the Composite Rating reveals how strongly a company is showing the seven telltale traits of winning stocks. For example, a rating of 95 means the company is outperforming 95% of all other stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.

The EPS Rating tracks a company's annual and quarterly earnings growth, then measures how its numbers stack up against those of all other stocks. So just like the Composite Rating, a score of 95 means the company's EPS growth is in the top 5% of all stocks.

Similarly, identifying stocks with strong fundamentals, the SMR Rating tracks sales growth, profit margins and return on equity as a whole. An A rating means the company is in the top 20% of all stocks in terms of those key fundamental performance metrics. Since it ties in with the legendary investor's focus on a company's fundamentals, this can be a particularly useful rating for investors looking for potential Warren Buffett stocks.
