WhatsApp, it said, could not rely on this article to process the data for improvement and security under its terms of service.\n\nThe NOYB group claims that, notwithstanding the DPC\u2019s delivery of decisions on the complaints, it has \u201cwholly failed\u201d to consider the effects of the reversal of its position and its obligation to investigate discrete processing actions complained of. It alleges the DPC did not address, either in whole or in part, nine discrete issues raised about Facebook, 10 issues concerning Instagram and seven issues raised about WhatsApp.\n\nThe NOYB centre is now asking the High Court to declare that the DPC has failed to carry out its investigation within a reasonable time frame, as required by the GDPR and/or the Data Protection Act of 2018. These include further complaints relating to other advertising.\n\nIt also wants the court to direct the DPC to complete its investigation of the complaints with \u201call due diligence\u201d.\n\nOn Monday, the NOYB group\u2019s lawyers said the DPC is obliged to investigate the complaints \u201cto the extent appropriate\u201d. The DPC maintains that this phrase relates to its assessment of what is appropriate, while the NOYB centre believes this is an objective test, the court heard.\n\nWhile only the NOYB group was represented in court and aware of the application, Mr Justice Charles Meenan granted permission for the judicial review action to be brought.\n\nThe judge said he was satisfied there were \u201carguable\u201d legal grounds in the case, which was adjourned."
