The company owns a host of casinos across the US, but it didn't include salary data for the hourly workers employed by its portfolio properties.\n\nIn a year marred by tech layoffs and a pullback on employee perks, Alphabet and Meta have cut around 33,000 staffers since 2022. Google's median pay package slipped from the top spot in 2021, according to the Journal's analysis.\n\nThe Journal reported that, overall, median salary ranges in 2022 didn't fall \"significantly\" from 2021, when public companies enjoyed large gains in the public markets.\n\nThe Journal calculated how much more CEOs earned than the company average by dividing the CEO's annual compensation, found in SEC filings, by the median pay.\n\nAmong the S&P 500 executives, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai took home the highest salary package of $226 million \u2014 808 times more than the company's median pay. Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg took home $28 million in compensation, 91 times more than its median pay. Vici Properties' CEO Edward Pitoniak had a pay ratio of 28 \u2014 down from 273 in 2021.\n\nWhile the data analyzed compensation from median workers, the Journal noted that, while companies have to disclose the total compensation offered to median employees globally, \"they have some latitude in how they identify their median worker.\""
