    "data": "San Francisco, June 18: Meta has developed a cutting-edge generative AI model \u2018Voicebox\u2019, designed to revolutionise the field of speech generation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed Voicebox, the first model that can generalise to speech-generation tasks it was not specifically trained to accomplish with state-of-the-art performance,\u201d Meta said in a blogpost. Meta Launches New Platform \u2018Take It Down\u2019 To Prevent Minors\u2019 Intimate Images Spreading Online.\n\nAccording to the company, Voicebox generates images and text in a variety of styles, and it can create outputs from scratch or modify samples provided to it. However, instead of creating a picture or a passage of text, Voicebox produces high-quality audio clips.\n\nThe model supports speech synthesis across six languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese, as well as performs noise removal, content editing, style conversion, and diverse sample generation. Meta Introduces Improved Avatars With New Body Shapes, Hair, Clothing Textures To Help Users To Better Express Themselves.\n\nMoreover, Meta said that Voicebox uses a new approach to learn just from raw audio and an accompanying transcription. Unlike autoregressive models for audio generation, Voicebox can modify any part of a given sample, not just the end of an audio clip it is given.\n\nFurther, the tech giant said that Voicebox is trained to predict a speech segment when given the surrounding speech and the transcript of the segment.\n\nOnce the model has learned to infill speech from context, it can be applied across a wide range of speech generation tasks, including generating portions of an audio recording without re-creating the entire recording.\n\nThis versatility enables Voicebox to perform well across a variety of tasks, including \u2014 in-context text-to-speech synthesis, cross-lingual style transfer, speech denoising and editing, and diverse speech sampling.\n\n(The above story first appeared on Fresh Headline on Jun 18, 2023 03:35 PM IST.
