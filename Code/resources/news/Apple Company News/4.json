    "data": "Like \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d and \u201cNapoleon\u201d before it, a third Apple movie, \u201cArgylle,\u201d will get a wide theatrical release before heading to streamer Apple TV+. Also like the other two, Matthew Vaughn\u2019s spy thriller starring Henry Cavill has its own unique theatrical-distribution partner: Universal Pictures.\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers,\u201d released by Paramount Pictures, and Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon,\u201d distributed by Sony, will both hit theaters this fall. \u201cArgylle\u201d will open in theaters on February 2, 2024; we do not yet have streaming-premiere dates for any of the three.\nJumping around between theatrical-distribution partners is an unusual strategy. One would expect that Apple would cut a deal with one theatrical partner, but that hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 yet \u2014 and it\u2019s starting to feel like tryouts.\nAlternatively, Apple could easily just buy a studio; it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest company by market cap. Apple rival Amazon, the second-largest company in the world by market cap, purchased MGM for $8.5 billion in March 2022 to help fuel its own sizable theatrical ambitions.\nLike the Sony deal for \u201cNapoleon,\u201d it is not clear if the Apple-Universal partnership is a one-off for \u201cArgylle\u201d or a sign of more to come between the two players. When reached by IndieWire, a rep for Apple had no comment on that very question. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d from Martin Scorsese, originated at Paramount \u2014 so that explains that particular partnership.\nAlso unclear is if \u201cArgylle\u201d will be released under the same arrangement Universal has with its other theatrical releases, in which movies that fall below a certain box-office threshold can be released on PVOD after just 17 days \u2014 or three weekends. We asked; Universal didn\u2019t respond.\nWhat we do know, at least according to a report, is that Apple is planning to invest $1 billion annually into movies with theatrical releases. Another big one is Joseph Kosinski\u2019s still-untitled Formula One racing movie starring Brad Pitt. When reached, Apple would not disclose which studio or distributor \u2014 if any \u2014 would get the nod to pair up on that one.\n\u201cNapoleon\u201d Courtesy of Apple\nVaughn directed and produced \u201cArgylle.\u201d In addition to Cavill, the impressive cast also includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O\u2019Hara, John Cena, Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\u201cArgylle\u201d is based on a script written by Jason Fuchs. The film is produced by Cloudy Productions and Vaughn\u2019s regular collaborators Adam Bohling and David Reid, as well as Fuchs. Zygi Kamasa, Carlos Peres, Claudia Vaughn, and Adam Fishbach serve as executive producers."
