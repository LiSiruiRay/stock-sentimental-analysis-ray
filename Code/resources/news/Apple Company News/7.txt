The list of companies in the $1 trillion club recently got a new entrant, with US chipmaker Nvidia becoming only the ninth company in the world to hit that milestone.

But do you know which of the other eight companies was the world’s first to hit the $1 trillion mark? Is it tech giant Apple or Elon Musk’s Tesla? No.

The world’s first company to hit $1 trillion in market value was Chinese oil giant PetroChina, that too sixteen years ago in the year 2007.

PetroChina, which was China's biggest oil and gas company at the time of its IPO, became the world’s first company to hit a market cap of $1 trillion in November 2007. As per various media reports, the company had seen its shares nearly triple in value in their first day of trading in Shanghai, following an IPO that raised 66.8 billion yuan ($8.94 billion).

The 4 billion new shares that were listed in Shanghai went on to surge to 43.96 yuan ($5.90) in the first day of trading, i.e., nearly triple the IPO price of 16.70 yuan ($2.24). At that time, after PetroChina’s IPO, China was home to five of the world's 10 most valuable companies: China Mobile, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Life Insurance, Sinopec, and PetroChina, as per The Guardian report.

As far as recent performance is concerned, PetroChina’s stock is up more than 50% this year to date. However, when seen over the long term, PetroChina's stock is down 3.5% in the last 5-year period and 80% since its IPO in November 2007.
