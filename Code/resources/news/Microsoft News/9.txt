Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion has divided international regulators, with the European Union approving the deal while the UK’s antitrust body rejected it. The split complicates the prospects for future mergers and could potentially curb value-adding acquisitions for big technology companies. Since the UK left the EU, its Competition and Markets Authority now acts as an independent regulator on large mergers. British lawmakers are currently debating legislation that would hand it more power to scrutinize big tech companies. The Microsoft-Activision deal could give Microsoft significant power in the cloud-gaming business and potentially hurt rivals such as Sony and Nintendo.

In line with a recent article on Barron’s, Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard has created a split among international regulators, which could have negative implications for future mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies. The European Union approved the deal on Monday, while the U.K.’s antitrust body had previously rejected it.

The split was caused by the fact that since the U.K. left the European Union, its Competition and Markets Authority now acts as an independent regulator on large mergers. British lawmakers are currently debating legislation that would give the authority more power to scrutinize big tech companies.

While European lawmakers have been vocal critics of big U.S. technology companies in the past, this week’s split suggests a shift that could see Britain replace the EU as one of the world’s toughest enforcers and the one to win over in terms of future megamergers.

There are lessons to be learned from the Microsoft-Activision deal that could help companies such as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta clear future hurdles.

The issue with the Microsoft-Activision deal is that it would give Microsoft significant power in the nascent cloud-gaming business. Cloud-gaming allows users to stream videogames via a variety of devices and could eventually replace consoles and gaming computers. Controlling Activision’s content could give Microsoft a powerful advantage in attracting users to its cloud-gaming service, potentially hurting rivals such as Sony and Nintendo.

Microsoft sought to offset concerns by offering a series of 10-year licensing agreements that would ensure European consumers could play all current and future Activision games on any cloud-gaming service of their choice, not just Microsoft’s.

The split among international regulators over the Microsoft-Activision deal could have negative implications for future mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies. It remains to be seen whether the U.K. will become one of the world’s toughest enforcers and the one to win over in terms of future megamergers. Companies such as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta will need to learn from this experience if they hope to clear future hurdles.
